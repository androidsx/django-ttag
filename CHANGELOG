Version 2.1
===========

* Added backwards compatibility for ``Arg.clean``, so it can once again just
  have ``data`` as the only parameter.

* Tidy up the handling of missing context variables (with bugfix in v2.1.1). 


Version 2.0
===========

Backwards Incompatible changes
------------------------------

* Changed ``Arg.clean`` to require both ``data`` and ``context`` as parameters.

* Changed the function of the ``null`` parameter of ``Arg.__init__``. Now,
  when set to ``False`` (default), an exception is raised on a missing context
  variable. When ``True``, a missing context variable is set to ``None``.
